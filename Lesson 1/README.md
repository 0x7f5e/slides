Hear Me Code Lesson 1
======

**What you'll learn:** 
* Storing information as a variable
* Displaying that information and text to the screen
* Finding the information you need from text
* Manipulating text
* Using the information you stored as a variable to make decisions

**Just a few practical examples:**
* Cleaning data entered from a spreadsheet or form
* Finding an area code from a phone number
* Counting the number of times a phrase appears in a body of text
* Determining whether a phone number or email address is valid and displaying different text based on the result

**Examples in real projects:**
* Remove common words like "the" from search terms to improve searches: https://github.com/shannonturner/bechdel/blob/master/apps/bechdel/views.py#L66
* If a search term begins with two **t**s, treat it differently: https://github.com/shannonturner/bechdel/blob/master/apps/bechdel/views.py#L60
* If a search term is too long, shorten it: https://github.com/shannonturner/bechdel/blob/master/apps/bechdel/views.py#L72
* Remove single-quotes and other punctuation from search terms: https://github.com/shannonturner/bechdel/blob/master/apps/bechdel/views.py#L58
* If this state has no quotes, display a message.  Otherwise, show the quotes: https://github.com/shannonturner/shut-that-down/blob/master/apps/shutthatdown/views.py#L150
