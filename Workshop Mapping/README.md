### Mapping Campus Sexual Assaults

This is a presentation to help introduce students to mapping, data visualization, and geocoding.

It's based on [a map I created of colleges and universities that reported zero sexual assaults on campus in a three-year period](https://shannonvturner.com/seriously).

See also [https://github.com/shannonturner/seriously](https://github.com/shannonturner/seriously) for the geocoder and resulting json.
