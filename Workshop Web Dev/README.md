### Introduction to Web Development

This is a presentation to help introduce students to web development in Django.

It's based on the [Digital Resolutions app I built for the Digital Resolutions party in January 2015](https://shannonvturner.com/resolutions)

Send a text message -> see your digital resolution up on the screen.

Uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to receive text messages and send them to the Django server for processing.

See also [https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution](https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution) for the Digital Resolutions code base.

#### Note

(This Django app was built in 2015 and uses Django 1.7; since then I have remixed it and have another version running on Django 1.11, which can be a little easier to set up and get running. See [https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution-2](https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution-2) for the code.)
