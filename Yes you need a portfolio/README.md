The presenters' notes have lots of helpful notes and can help give you an idea of my train of thought as I put together this presentation.

### Description

Having a personal website can help you connect with prospective employers and the broader tech community. Learn how to build one that helps you showcase your talents.

This talk focuses more on considering personal goals that influence design choices and less on the mechanics of building a website. Who is your audience? What do you want to communicate to your audience? Questions like this are important to consider as part of the design process.

Finally, by reviewing other websites, we can better understand what design choices others have made -- and which styles and design choices we may want to emulate.

### Audience

This talk is designed especially for people who are interested in building a personal website to show off their work. No specific skill set is necessary. People who have created projects but haven't yet put them in a single place or people who want to redesign an existing personal website will get the most out of this.
